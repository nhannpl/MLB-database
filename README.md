#Running Project Group 48
##Set up
Run the MLB.sql file on your uranium server account to create the tables.
We ran the MLB.sql file using VS Code to create our tables for example.

Change the username and password in the auth.cfg file to your credentials.
To open the TUI you just need all of the files in the same place and 
type "make run" on the command line.

We performed all of our test on aviary.
